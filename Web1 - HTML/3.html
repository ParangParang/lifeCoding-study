        <p>
          JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[11] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
          <br>
          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[12] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.[14] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
          <br>
          As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
          <br>
          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
          <br>
          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
          <br>
          Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
